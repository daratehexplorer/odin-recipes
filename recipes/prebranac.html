            <p></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>800g dry butter beans</li>
                <li>2 yellow onions, chopped</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, diced</li>
                <li>3 bay leaves</li>
                <li>80ml neutral oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegeta</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place your dry beans in a bowl and cover with water at a 2 to 1 ratio of water to beans. Soak your beans overnight, for at least 10 hours.</li>
                <li>When ready to begin cooking, drain any excess water from the beans and transfer them to your pot.</li>
                <li>Begin cooking your beans on medium-high heat until they reach a boil. Once they reach a boil, reduce the heat slightly to medium and cook for 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain the beans again and refill the pot 3/4 of the way full with fresh water. Add 1 bay leaf and 15 ml of oil to the pot.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking the beans for 40-60 minutes until they are just about cooked completely. Turn off the heat and remove the bay leaf. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, add the chopped onions and diced garlic. Add the oil to the skillet and begin to saute the onions and garlic on medium-low heat. Add salt, black pepper and vegeta.</li>
                <li>Once the onions have become translucent and begin to take on a light brown color, turn off the heat and add in all of the paprika. Stir everything to combine.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C.</li>
                <li>Transfer 1/3 of the beans to the bottom of a baking pan or oven-safe casserole dish using a slotted spoon. Next, place 1/3 of the onion mixture on top of the beans and spread as evenly as possible across the top. Continue this layering process with the rest of the beans and onion mixture.</li>
                <li>Once all the ingredients have been used up, ladle in 2-3 spoonfuls of the bean cooking liquid into the skillet and scrape the sides and bottom to lift all the seasonings remaining in the skillet. Pour this liquid on top of the beans and gently move the beans around to ensure the liquid is evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining bay leaves to the dish, pressing them towards the bottom of the dish so they aren’t exposed.</li>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and transfer it to the oven. Bake for 25 minutes, then uncover the baking dish and bake for another 15-20 minutes until a nice brown crust forms at the top.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
