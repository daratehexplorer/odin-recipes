                    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Dough</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>120ml sparkling water</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
                    <li>375g phyllo pastry</li>
                    <li>1 egg, beaten for egg wash</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Line the base of a 20x20cm square tin with a square of parchment and grease the sides.</li>
                <li>Using a large bowl, take a fork and press down on the feta crumbling it but leaving a few little lumps of feta. Add the beaten eggs, minced garlic, grated parmesan or pecorino, yogurt, milk, oil, salt and baking powder. Place the sparkling water and tablespoon of oil in a separate cup and have a pastry brush ready.</li>
                <li>Open the filo pastry and cover it with a tea towel. Layer two pieces of filo criss cross across the bottom, one covering the top to bottom and the other from side to side. Brush with some water/oil on the base. Reserve one sheet of filo for the end.</li>
                <li>Take a sheet of filo and crumple it up and dip it in the cheese mixture. Make sure to soak it well, you don't want any dry pastry bits. Scrunch into a loose ball and place the wet pastry it on the base of the tin. Repeat until you get a layer of 9 or so rounds, then repeat with a second layer of this on top of the first - try and use up all of the cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Fold in the filo on the side and then add the extra reserved sheet of filo on top and tuck it under the sides. Then, brush generously with the oil/water mixture all over the top of the pastry, particularly down the sides of the gibanica.</li>
                <li>Beat the extra egg with what is left in the bowl of the cheese mixture and pour over the top brushing it out to the edge.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with sesame seeds and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool for 10 minutes and then slice and serve.</li>
            </ol>
