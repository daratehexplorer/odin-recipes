            <p>Burek is a traditional Balkan pie made with phyllo dough and usually filled with meat or cheese. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients for meat burek</h2>

                    <li>3 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
                    <li>400 milliliters warm water</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Filling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>500 grams ground beef</li>
                    <li>600 grams potatoes</li>
                    <li>1 yellow onion</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
                    <li>50 milliliters warm water</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Topping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>400 milliliters warm water</li>
                </ul>    
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Preparing the stuffing</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the filling ingredients. Mix well until integrated.</li> 
                    <li>Divide the stuffing into 3 parts, one for each dough ball (the big dough ball gets divided in the next step). You can leave it in the same bowl, or in separate ones.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Preparing the phyllo dough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl combine flour, salt, and oil. Start working the flour into dough by adding a little bit of water at a time, and kneading the ingredients. Keep adding water slowly while you fold, press, knead, push and punch the mixture (just as if you were making bread or pizza) for about 2-3 minutes. Once you form a cohesive, messy, wetter, dough ball with your ingredients, wash and dry your hands.</li>
                    <li>Continue to knead the dough ball vigorously, with all your strength, for an additional 8-10 minutes, even 15 minutes if you can. As you work it, the dough will firm up but stay smoother overall. If it’s too sticky, dust small amounts of flour back in as you knead, until you reach the right consistency.</li>
                    <li>Once you achieve the right consistency, dab the dough ball with oil generously, on all sides. Cover in saran wrap, and then with a kitchen towel. Leave it to rest for at least 60 minutes in a relatively warm space.</li> 
                    <li>Uncover and transfer the dough ball onto your working space. Cut it into three equal parts. Lightly dust them with flour and knead each for 2-3 minutes. Shape each part into a smaller dough ball, and place it on a tray. </li>
                    <li>Dab the balls with oil generously. Again, cover each first with saran wrap, then with a kitchen towel. Finally, leave them to rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Uncover the first dough ball. Transfer it to the working space lightly dusted with flour. Punch it gently to flatten it a bit. Then take the rolling pin and roll it out until it's about 10-12 inches (25 cm) in diameter. Repeat this with the other two balls. </li>    
                    <li>You can leave the flattened dough balls on the working space or place each on a separate tray. Dab each with oil on both sides. Once more, cover with saran wrap and then a kitchen towel. Let them rest for the final 15 minutes in a warm space. </li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Stretching the phyllo dough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Transfer one flattened dough ball onto the working space and roll it out with oklagija until it's (approximately) the thickness of a couple of stacked pennies, and the size of a huge pizza. Lightly dab with 2-3 teaspoons of oil (or melted butter), and drape over the middle of the rolling pin. To do this, dust the rolling pin with flour and position it in the middle of your dough (as if you were measuring its diameter). Then drape one side of the dough over the rolling pin, and lift everything up. The dough should hang equally on both sides.</li>
                    <li>Let the dough weigh itself down on the rolling pin for several seconds. Now turn the dough around 45 degrees and let it weigh itself down on this side as well. Then, slowly and carefully start stretching the dough even further with the tops of your hands (knuckles), as far as it will go. Work ends and the middle equally, and move towards where the phyllo is thicker, so you can thin it out.</li>
                    <li>Gently transfer the dough to your working area and continue stretching it out as much as it'll go. The dough should now be coming close to the thinness of cigarette paper and the size of a super large circle (or an ellipse). If at some point(s) during stretching the dough needs more oil (or butter), dab it in again, 2-3 tablespoons at a time. (The dough needs to be well-oiled, but not "swimming" in oil at all times.) Finally, shape the dough into either an approximation of a rectangle or a circle (look at the stuffing methods). </li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Stuffing and shaping the phyllo dough</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Dab the dough with 2-3 tablespoons of oil.</li>
                    <li>Grab batched of the prepared filling with your hands and walk around the dough lining the dough ends with the filling. Stuff it evenly, about 2 inches/ 3cm (or more if the dough is hanging off the table) away from the dough edges. (The filling should be the thickness of about 2-3 fingers.) Starting at any point, lift the end of the dough and cover the filling completely. Do this for the entire dough circle, covering all the filling.</li>
                    <li>Start rolling the filling and the dough together. Essentially, you're rolling the dough with the filling toward the middle of the circle for a few inches and then pulling it back toward yourself carefully. (For best results use the same method as before, pulling with the tops of your hands.) Do this at the same pace all around the circle, so that all areas are equally stuffed and rolled. (What you don't want is to roll one side completely, and the other one not having enough dough so the filling is exposed.) </li>
                    <li>After a few rounds of rolling the entire dough, it will tear in the middle, or it will have several rips and tears. Keep on rolling the dough until most of the middle is torn. (Alternatively, you can cut it with a knife.) When you decide that all the circle's ends have had about the same amount of dough you can cut the remaining middle dough part out. (You can stuff this part, discard it, or roll it in on a thinner end of your burek.) You should now be left with a large hula hoop-shaped dough stuffed with filling.</li>
                    <li>Repeat above steps for remaining 2 dough balls</li>
                    <li>Generously grease a round baking pan. Starting in the middle, circle the burek around itself until you fill the pan up. (If you have more burek left over, make small rounds and bake them in a different pan.) Dab it with oil on top, then bake. </li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Baking and topping the burek</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 220°C.</li>
                    <li>Once heated, bake the burek for 10-15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 200°C for 20-35 minutes.  If it starts to blush too much, cover the burek with baking paper for the remainder of the baking.</li>
                    <li>A few minutes before the burek is done baking, in a small pot heat up butter and water together.</li>
                    <li>Once the burek is finished, sprinkle it very generously with the water and butter mixture. Then, cover it with a kitchen cloth, and leave it to rest for about 20 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
